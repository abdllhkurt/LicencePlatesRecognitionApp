# LicencePlatesRecognitionApp (Bachelor's Degree Graduation Project)

I aim to establish a mobile application supported parking system. I am developing an application that reads the license plates, checks for enrty and exit, checks the right vehicle, and performs vip entry
through the OpenCV library. I aim to develop a mobile application that includes pre-registration so that users can park their vehicles at their destination.
